# DONE - Development Log

## Initial Setup (2025-06-20)

### Created Project Structure
- Created TODO.md with command line tool specifications divided into 3 phases
- Created DONE.md for tracking development progress
- Created initial CLAUDE.md for AI assistant guidance

### Project Specifications Defined
The aishell project will be a Python-based command line tool with the following capabilities:
- Phase 1: Web search, intelligent shell, file system search
- Phase 2: LLM integration (single and multiple), MCP server communication
- Phase 3: Code generation, database operations, RAG integration, hardware control

### Files Created:
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/TODO.md`
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/DONE.md`
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/CLAUDE.md` (created earlier)

## Phase 1 - Step 1: Python Project Setup (2025-06-20)

### Created Basic Python Package Structure
- Created `.gitignore` with Python-specific exclusions
- Created `requirements.txt` with core dependencies:
  - click (CLI framework)
  - requests (HTTP library for web search)
  - rich (terminal formatting)
  - Development tools: pytest, black, flake8, mypy
- Created `setup.py` for package installation
- Created `README.md` with project overview and usage instructions

### Created Package Directory Structure
```
aishell/
├── __init__.py
├── cli.py           # Main CLI entry point
├── commands/        # Command implementations
│   └── __init__.py
├── utils/           # Utility functions
│   └── __init__.py
└── search/          # Search functionality
    └── __init__.py
```

### Implemented Basic CLI Framework
- Created `aishell/cli.py` with Click framework
- Defined main command group with version option
- Added placeholder commands:
  - `search`: Web search functionality
  - `find`: File system search
  - `shell`: Interactive shell mode
- Integrated Rich console for formatted output

### Entry Point Configuration
- Configured `console_scripts` in setup.py
- Tool will be accessible via `aishell` command after installation

### Files Modified/Created:
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/.gitignore`
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/requirements.txt`
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/setup.py`
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/README.md`
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/aishell/__init__.py`
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/aishell/cli.py`
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/aishell/commands/__init__.py`
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/aishell/utils/__init__.py`
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/aishell/search/__init__.py`

### Next Steps:
1. Implement web search functionality
2. Implement intelligent shell
3. Implement file system search

## Phase 1 - Step 2: Web Search with Playwright (2025-06-20)

### Updated Dependencies
- Added Playwright for browser automation
- Added BeautifulSoup4 and lxml for HTML parsing
- Added pytest-asyncio for async testing support

### Implemented Web Search Module
Created `aishell/search/web_search.py` with:
- `WebSearcher` class using async context manager pattern
- Support for headless Chrome via Playwright
- Google search implementation with result parsing
- DuckDuckGo search implementation as alternative
- Rich console output with formatted tables and panels
- Error handling and graceful degradation

### Updated CLI for Web Search
Modified `aishell/cli.py` to:
- Import and use the async web search functionality
- Added `--engine` option to choose between Google and DuckDuckGo
- Added `--show-browser` flag to disable headless mode for debugging
- Integrated asyncio for running async search functions

### Created Playwright Installation Script
- Added `scripts/install_playwright.py` for easy browser installation
- Made script executable for convenience
- Includes helpful notes about system dependencies

### Updated Documentation
- Modified README.md with Playwright installation instructions
- Added usage examples for web search with various options
- Documented the need to install Playwright browsers

### Files Modified/Created:
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/requirements.txt` (added Playwright dependencies)
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/setup.py` (updated install_requires)
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/aishell/search/web_search.py` (new)
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/aishell/cli.py` (added web search implementation)
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/scripts/install_playwright.py` (new)
- `/Users/nitin/Projects/github/aishell/README.md` (updated with Playwright setup)

### Implementation Details:
- Uses Playwright's async API for better performance
- Headless Chrome by default, with option to show browser
- Parses search results using BeautifulSoup
- Displays results in both table and detailed panel format
- Supports limiting number of results
- Handles errors gracefully with informative messages
